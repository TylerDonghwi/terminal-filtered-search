# terminal-filtered-search
Automating Google searches from the terminal with filters to increase productivity while programming

### Example usage
I set the $Profile for the powershell so that by prompting "ligma" followed by the search query in Powershell (in any directory), it opens up a chrome tab and gives me results only from the websites in the filtered website.
